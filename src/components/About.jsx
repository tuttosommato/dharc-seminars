    The “Learning” session opens with two <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">introductory talks</span> by Professors Francesca Tomasi and
    Giovanni Colavizza, framing the intersection of AI and DH. <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">Three “Expert Dialogues”</span> follow with the
    invited experts. Each is built around a presentation of the guest’s work followed by an active
    discussion led by a PhD student acting as discussant. The discussant works like a Chair, formulating critical questions and facilitating
    the exchange with the audience. The format stages a <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">structured dialogue</span> between an <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">established
    expert</span> and an <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">early-career researcher</span>.

    The second session, “Sharing”, is dedicated to <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">real use cases</span> from the two centres. It
    is organised in blocks: in each, a researcher from the partner centre and a /DH.arc PhD student
    present their respective projects, comparing tools, workflows, and open problems, followed by a
    <span className="italic text-accent font-medium"> round of critical feedback</span>. The aim is operational — to surface what is being done, how, and
    where there is <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">room for collaboration</span>, while preparing participants for a moment of critical
    feedback on the research. The session closes with a <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">roundtable</span> in which the speakers identify
    affinities between projects and outline possible directions for joint work in the months that
    follow.

    title: 'Hackathon · Efficient RAG: less is more',
    body: <>
    The second day is a <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">hands-on hackathon</span> focused on <span className="italic text-accent font-medium">Retrieval-Augmented Generation</span>, with an
    emphasis on the efficiency of small models and the creativity of the proposed pipelines.
    Participants — who need a basic familiarity with Python and work in a preconfigured Jupyter
    environment — are challenged to optimise a claim-verification RAG pipeline, aiming to beat a
    baseline score using smaller, less resource-intensive language models (SLMs). Solutions are
    judged on efficiency, creativity, reproducibility, and collaboration. Teams of two to four
    submit their code and a short report; each project is then run on the full dataset by the
    organisers, and scores are revealed on screen to announce the winners.
